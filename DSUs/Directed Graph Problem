Dynamic Connectivity:[ adding edged - without deletion ]
     n*n solution with bitset
     every edged has bitset[u]: for reachability
     in dfs(for auto v:g[u])
        {
            if( !vis[v] )
            {
               dfs(v);
               bitse[u]|=bitset[v];
            }
        }
        
        
   It was problem on codeforecs [ i forgot ]
   see paper on library.
