Given a text t and a string s, we want to find and display the positions of all occurrences of the string s in the text t.
find prefix function of string s+'#'+t
in pi when pi[i]==s.length() then it is the last index of matched substring which is equal to s
because pi[i]:will be the longest prifix which is also suffix.
