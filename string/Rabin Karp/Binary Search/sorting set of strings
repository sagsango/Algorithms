O(n*m + n*log(n)*log(m))
n:no of strings
m:max length

n*m : making hash vector
n*log(n)*log(m) : n*log(n) it is for merge sort
                  but comarision takes O(1) times when we are dealing with number
                  but here we will use binary serach for compirision of strings : log(m)
                  so total n*log(n)*log(m)
