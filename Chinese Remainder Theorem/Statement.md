#Wikipidia :
  In number theory, the Chinese remainder theorem states that if one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division
  of an integer n by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of n by the product
  of these integers, under the condition that the "divisors are pairwise coprime".
