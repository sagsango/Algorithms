->Primes similar to dijstra
->Dijstra works on dircted + undirected [ but should not have negative cycyle]
->Primes on undirected [selected source may not reach every node] [ Not have negative cycyle]
  or find all possible source then apply primes on every source
->Kruskal works fine on undirected
  [ Little more constrain can give you MST : indegre should not be more than 1, you can maintain during forming it
    same complexity O( log(e) ) ]
