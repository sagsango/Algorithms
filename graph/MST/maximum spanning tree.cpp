A maximum spanning tree is a spanning tree of a weighted graph having maximum weight.
You can compute maximum spanning tree using Kruskal Algorithm with edges sorted into decreasing order.

The same thing as an algorithm to find the Minimum spanning tree (after you multiplied the cost of each edge by -1).
