In directed graph set of verticies which are reachable from eath others , forms strongly connected components.

we reverse the direction of the edges .
then do dfs with storing their postvisit numbers.
the sort them in reverse order of their postvisit number.
then perform dfs to get connected components there r strongly conncted components.
