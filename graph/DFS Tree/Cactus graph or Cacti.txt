We talk about Vertex Cactus graph:-[ which is easy solvable by DGS Graph]
A connected undirected graph is called a vertex cactus if each vertex of this graph belongs to no more than one simple cycle.

Other Types of Catalog Graphs:-
A cactus is a graph where every edge (or sometimes, vertex) belongs to at most one simple cycle. 
The first case is called an edge cactus, the second case is a vertex cactus. Cacti have a simpler
structure than general graphs, as such it is easier to solve problems on them than on general graphs.
But only on paper: cacti and cactus algorithms can be very annoying to implement if you don't think
about what you are doing.

In the DFS tree of a cactus, for any span-edge, at most one back-edge passes over it. This puts cycles
to an one-to-one correspondence with simple cycles:
each back-edge forms a simple cycle together with the span-edges it passes over;
there are no other simple cycles.
This captures most properties of cacti. Often, it is easy to implement cactus algorithms using DFS TREE representation.
