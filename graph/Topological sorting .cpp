privisit[ v  ]  =  time when we r going to start all the neighbours of v.
postvisit[ v ]  =  time when we have finished exploration all the neighbours of v.


if we sort the verticies in reverse order of their postvisit number then it will form a possible topological sort.
because sources have greater postvisit number and sinc have smaller postvisit number.
